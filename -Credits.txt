Special thanks to these people for making their awesome scripts and mods for free for everyone to use!
They helped me out making project VINTIGO a lot!
(Note: These are the guys that made this mission possible. More credit is given elsewhere)

Ppgtjmad for his quality shop system, SimpleShops!
Special thanks to him, I'm using his SQL system
(SimpleShops is using an old and buggy extDB3, so I decided to live with his workarounds insted of updating it)

Massive thanks to Diwako and his Stalker Anomalies scripts!
Although I couldn't use them fully, I'm happy to say they work perfectly!

Torndeco for the extDB3 mod! Without this, we wouldn't have datbase connection in Arma 3.

The ACE team for their awesome ACE3 mod!
Although their medical documentation is lacking still, everything else is extremely well documented.
Tips to that!

Shoutout to the Ravage mod creators!
Although I am using their zombies, and I should give credit, it is a massive pain in the ass to work with the mod.
Thanks to their enclosed behaviour (no git, no proper wiki, not even a basic function explanation, 
and their code looks like a bigol' mess. It's incredibly difficult to understand their code properly, and issues
are baked into everything they created. If you dare use any of their stuff without their systems it's bound
to give errors. Will definitely switch this mod to something else.
