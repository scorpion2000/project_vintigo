# Project VINTIGO FAQ
Q: What is Project VINTIGO?

A: Project VINTIGO is a survival mission made for MILSIM groups who want to have a challanging experience.


Q: What can you do in Project VINTIGO?

A: Apart from basic Survival, you'll be able to join the VINTIGO orgranization, or the Phoenix regime. Both sides have their unique objectives to win the mission.

Q: So this mission can be completed?

A: Yes. The aim of Project VINTIGO is to have a hardcore survival element to playing missions. You'll get objectives to finish on both VINTIGO and Phoenix sides.


Q: So is this PvP, or PvE?

A: The aim is to be PvP, but you can always have your group play on one side only for a PvE experience.


Q: So if it's about survival, will there be zombies and such?

A: Yes, but not in the traditional way. Zombies are scarce. Their porpuse is to make gunfights more strategic (meaning they will walk towards gunshots, but they are generally pretty chill). Plus there will be some objectives where a large amount of them might be present.


Q: Which map is this mission made for?

A: Any. They were mostly tested on BIS maps, but it should work on any map as long as locations are properly defined


Q: Does this mission require anything special to run?

A: Yes, it requires a MySQL database connection. If you don't know how to set one up, I recommend starting with XAMPP, importing the SQL file from the PRV_SQL folder, and setting up ports properly. You will find a @extDB3 folder in the PRV_SQL folder, that should be added as a server side mod.


Q: Is this mission persistant then?

A: Yes. The mission saves player stats (location, gear and what not), some vehicles that got saved, some event locations and stats, and of course, objectives, meaning you can finish X objectives, come back a week later and continue from where you left off.


Q: What's the current stage of Project VINTIGO?

A: It is currently in Alpha.


Q: Sale prices are incredibly low in the VINTIGO base?

A: VINTIGO does not need the money, and they are generally not interested in buying and selling stuff. Because of this, sale prices are low, and buy prices are really high.


Q: The Phoenix Regime is underpowered compared to the Vintigos?!

A: Yes. They scavanged what they could find in a post apocalyptic eastern europe, and they are only willing to depart with their average stuff. You might see some Phoenix Regime soldiers using better guns and vehicles compared to what they offer you at their shops. Do not forget, both the Vintigos and the Phoenix Regime consideres you as mercenaries, making good gear prices go really high or outright unavailable.


Q: Are there planes in this gamemode?

A: No, but we do have helicopters!


Q: Can we fully join a side?

A: No. While the gamemode calls you a mercenary, you can always call yourself loyal, and a soldier of your choosed side. It's all in the roleplay!


Q: It's really hard to find good loot! Are there any special conditions for good loot to appear?

A: No. Loot is meant to be generally scarce. Scavangers have looted and sold most things to either factions. Finding gear is easy, finding GOOD gear is difficult.


Q: Do military vehicles spawn, or am I just unlucky?

A: Military vehicles do spawn, but their numbers are much lower than your average vehicle. Not only that, but heavily armored or gunned vehicles are really rare.


Q: Is there base building in this gamemode?

A: Sort of. You'll be able to create a "hideout" where you can stash your loot, and get a virtual garage with it. While we value hoarding good gear for resupply purpuses, it is generally not the point of the gamemode to build a base.
